        <h1>Research</h1>
        <p>Our lab combines field studies, experimental approaches, laboratory methods, and quantitative modeling to provide science to inform sustainable marine fisheries management under anthropogenic stressors throughout tropical seas.<p>
        <h2>Essential fish habitat and species distribution modeling<h2>
        <p>Essential fish habitats are areas of the ocean necessary for fish reproduction, growth, feeding, and shelter. We use species distribution models to predict the distribution of marine fish and invertebrates across geographic areas in the ocean based on biological observations and environmental data. Model results can be used for fishery management and conservation purposes. Past research examples include (<a href="https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v481/p121-132/" class="badge badge-info">Hawaiian corals</a>) and (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165783617301662?via%3Dihub" class="badge badge-info"> Hawaiian deepwater snapper-grouper complex.</a>)<p>
        <h2>Fish life history studies<h2>
        <p>Life history studies seek to better understand the age, growth, diet, and reproduction of fishes which are important biological details essential for sustainable fisheries management. Since many species lack life history information in tropical seas, we use field and laboratory methods to age fish using otoliths, document diet via visual and genetic gut content analysis and tissue stable isotope studies, and identify fish sex and maturity phase from histology of gonads. These Data collected from the biological samples provide inputs for models to understand the growth trajectory of fish or their size-at-maturity. Past research examples include (<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.15644" class="badge badge-info">errors in estimating reproductive parameters with macroscopic methods</a>) and an (<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344445372_Standard_operating_procedure_for_histology-based_rapid_reproductive_analysis_of_tropical_fishes" class="badge badge-info"> SOP for histology-based rapid reproductive analysis of tropical fishes.</a>)<p>
        <h2>Fishery stock assessments, marine reserves, management strategy evaluation<h2>
        <p>Stock assessments involve data collection, analysis, and reporting to determine the condition of a fish stock and estimate its sustainable yield. Marine reserves are spatial fishery closures used to achieve fishery management and conservation goals. Management strategy evaluation uses computer simulations to compare the ability of different combinations of data collection and analysis and fishery harvest rules to achieve previously agreed management objectives. Past research examples include (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0308597X23000465?via%3Dihub" class="badge badge-info">Indonesian small pelagic fish stock assessment</a>) and an (<a href="https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/10.1139/cjfas-2016-0200" class="badge badge-info">MSE for Hawaiian marine protected areas under future conditions.</a>)<p>
        <h2>Community-based fisheries management and science capacity building <h2>
        <p>We provide science to support community-based fishery management approaches in the Hawaiian Islands for intertidal fisheries and Hawaiian fishponds or loko i’a. To build local scientific expertise, we also lead training workshops for fishery science students and professionals throughout the Western Pacific region including Guam, American Samoa, Indonesia, and Fiji. Past research examples include detailing (<a href="https://escholarship.org/uc/item/08b9x8t9" class="badge badge-info"> ʻāina momona principles to support Hawaiian ‘opihi intertidal fisheries management,</a>) (<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aff2.68" class="badge badge-info">understanding predator-prey dynamics in Hawaiian fishponds</a>) and (<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/357420632_Capacity_development_in_reproductive_life_history_studies_of_tropical_fishes_in_Ambon_Maluku_Indonesia_for_data_limited_fisheries" class="badge badge-info">capacity building for reproductive studies in Indonesia.</a>)<p>
        <h2>Quantitative coral reef ecology, invasive species, and ecoinformatics<h2>
        <p>Coral ecological theory underpins much of the scientific framework for resource management practices. We perform field and lab studies to determine biotic and abiotic factors that influence the distribution and abundance of marine organisms on coral reefs, including invasive species. Invasive species are any non-native marine species that causes or could cause harm to natural resources, economy, or human health. In the waters surrounding the Hawaiian Islands, there are hundreds of species identified as invasive. Ecoinformatics integrates the ecological and information sciences to define entities and processes with language common to both humans and computers that transitions ecological results from research outputs to decision-making information. Past research examples include an integrated oceanography, ecology, and genetics study for the population connectivity of a coral reef fish, a study on a purported invasive octocoral species to Hawaii, a time-series study of Nautilus populations in Palau and GeoSymbio: a hybrid web application for global geospatial informatics of Symbiodinium symbioses.<p>
        <h2>Global environmental change <h2>
        <p>Global-scale stressors impact human society and the natural environment leading to changes in the dynamics of atmospheric and oceanic systems. We use outputs from general circulation models that represent physical processes of Earth to understand the impact that different stressors have on the global system. Past research examples include the influence on environmental hazards on human infectious diseases and the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.<p>
        <h2>Restoration aquaculture and responsible marine stock enhancement<h2>
        <p>Restoration aquaculture provides an economically-sustainable commercial aquaculture practice that has a positive ecological impact. Responsible marine stock enhancement uses effective, scientifically-based research to develop the technology for spawning and rearing fish for release to enhance or help restore coastal populations targeted by fisheries. This is a new area of research for the lab.<p>
